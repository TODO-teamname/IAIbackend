//TODO: Team Name

Iteration 02 - Review & Retrospect
When: November 7th
Where: Online
NOTE: Lots of work was done locally by many team members, which resulted in few commits shown, even though the amount of work was pretty much the same for everyone.
Process (team organization) reflection
Q1. Decisions that turned out well
Continuous communication on Discord was a successful decision because it allowed us to learn about each other’s work habits and to openly communicate the challenges we encountered. It was great to receive feedback and support from teammates in the group chat, and to evolve and integrate our design decisions to use in the most efficient way our time.
Initial planning on the Jira Board using Scrum Agile methodology was a successful decision because it allowed us to have a clear vision for our design. This made working on the frontend components easy, and most importantly allowed us to achieve a clear and shared design vision, making sure we chose consistent colours and elements.
Coding on related components during a call/together in person. The team members that chose this approach had many advantages, especially when it came to handling changes that affected both components. However, we did not have enough of these kinds of sessions, and so we plan to increase them.
Splitting the team into frontend and backend sub-teams allowed for a greater depth of understanding across the broad regards to the actual work being done by each team member. In addition, several team members had a sufficiently broad understanding of the project overall to clarify any integration problems or misunderstandings.
Q2. Decisions that did not turn out as well as we hoped
Having a 2-week Sprint was an unsuccessful decision because it was too long and too broad, thus difficult to keep our focus on concrete tasks. It was also hard to maintain the team’s momentum working through the 2-week Sprint.
We chose to pick times for meetings to discuss progress before the deadline as we seemed fit, in hope to maximize time usage; however, this led to lots of problems in picking up times in which everyone could meet. This resulted in choosing meeting times when either we could not all attend, or meeting very late with respect to the deadline.
Using Jira to manage the project branches (i.e. having branches named after issue on Jira) was intended but not followed through on as it proved to be easy to forget and represented an oversight, especially when the code being worked on could not be very accurately summarized in a single issue (see git branch names).
Having regular weekly meetings with IAI was incredibly useful in developing the team’s understanding of the project, however on certain weeks we ran out of time in the meeting and couldn’t ask all of our questions, and on other weeks we only took up a small fraction of the allotted time. Adjusting the meeting length ahead of time based on the number of questions the team expects to have might be a better use of everyone’s time.

Q3. Planned changes
We are planning to change our Sprint length from 2 weeks to 1 week and break down the backlog tasks into smaller chunks so that we can keep our focus and dedicate effort to complete manageable action items. Also, having shorter Sprints will enable us to conduct retrospective meetings more frequently, hence improving our development process and building our product iteratively and incrementally.

We are also planning to set up fixed times for meetings near the next deadlines, making sure that we have plenty of time to address last minute changes and merges.

We are also planning to set up some pair programming sessions, or at least to have more sessions where we are on a call together while working on different components. Those of us who chose this approach found significant benefits and less trouble when it came to merging or discussing changes. 

Product review
Q4. How was your product demo?

We prepared our demo in our team meeting by showing the key features we implemented in a video that we sent via email. This delivery method allowed us more time to finish the demo and our partners more flexibility in reviewing what we built so far, giving them the opportunity to rewatch the demo many times.  We spent time discussing the most concise way of presenting the application and explained the features aligning with the user stories. Then, we screen recorded the demo to make it accessible to our partner organization and TAs.

We managed to demo to our partner the key features that are essential to the MVP, including
admin users creating a study and attaching MOOClet object to it
admin and staff users getting reformatted data for specific studies
Admin logging in through a secure login system
Login page 
dashboard page where users can perform various actions

Our partners received the video, but did not let us know their opinions on the final demo. However, during the week we had the opportunity to share with the partners our individual features and told them which features were going to be ready for the demo. We let them know how things were progressing…

Our partner didn’t request any significant changes to the features we developed for the demo. They are happy about our progress towards the MVP they wanted, even though they still need to share their final thoughts on the final demo. 

From doing the demo, we learnt that a video demo was probably the best option for our current situation. The demo video can be viewed at the following link:
